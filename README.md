## Introduction
`iso3166-flags` is a **comprehensive**, **verbose** and **bespoke** repository of all ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 country and regional/subdivision flag icons, respectively. The flags list is according to the International Organisation for Standards that define codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, special areas of geographical interest, and their principal subdivisions [[1]](#references). 

**Currently the dataset contains <em>271</em> ISO 3166-1 country/territorial flag icons and <em>2,845</em> ISO 3166-2 regional/subdivision flags.** <br> 

The <b>ISO 3166-1</b> flags are those of the names of countries and their subdivisions that can be broken into three sets of country codes:
* *ISO 3166-1 alpha-2* ‚Äì two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the three, and used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions).
* *ISO 3166-1 alpha-3* ‚Äì three-letter country codes which allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes.
* *ISO 3166-1 numeric* ‚Äì three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or systems using non-Latin scripts.

The <b>ISO 3166-2</b> icons are those of the names of countries and their subdivisions ‚Äì *Part 2: Country subdivision code, defines codes for identifying the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces, states, departments, regions) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.* [[2]](#references). <br>

The <b>ISO 3166-3</b> icons are those of countries and their subdivisions ‚Äì Part 3: Code for formerly used names of countries, defines codes for country names which have been deleted from ISO 3166-1 since its first publication in 1974. This section of the ISO 3166 is not utilised in this repo.

### Motivation
`iso3166-flags` is a part of a larger suite of my **custom-built and bespoke applications** that utilise the ISO 3166 country and subdivision codes. The primary application is [`iso3166-2`][iso3166_2] which is is a structured lightweight custom-built Python package and dataset, and accompanying RESTful API, that can be used to access all of the world's ISO 3166-2 subdivision data. 

One of the attributes in the `iso3166-2` software package is the `flag` attribute - the subdivisions offical flag. When creating this dataset, there was no accurate or widely available dataset of the world's thousands of regional flags, **so I created one!** 

<!-- Alongside the `iso3166-2` software, I also created the [`iso3166-updates`][iso3166_updates] repo. This is a software and accompanying REST API that checks for any updates/changes to the ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 country codes and subdivision naming conventions, as per the ISO 3166 newsletter (https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) and Online Browsing Platform (OBP) (https://www.iso.org/obp/ui). Thus it ensures the `iso3166-2` and `iso3166-flags` are kept up-to-date. -->

<!-- ### Motivation

The main motivation behind this project was to integrate additional flag icons into my custom-built web-app <b>Flagle</b> (https://flagle.vercel.app/). This daily worldle-inspired game generates a new flag from around the world each day, consisting of flags of countries, territories and everywhere in between. <br>

After searching around, it was fairly straightforward to find a repo with ISO 3166-1 flags, an example being [here][flag-icons-repo] but there didn't seem to be any single repo/dataset of all ISO 3166-2 subdivision flags, hence I decided to make one from scratch. <br> -->

## Installation
The whole project can be cloned from git:
```
git clone https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-flags.git
```

The ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 are also split into branches and be downloaded seperately:
```
git clone -b iso3166-1-flags https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-flags.git 
OR
git clone -b iso3166-2-flags https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-flags.git 
```

Install via npm or yarn (<b><i>not implemented yet</i></b>):
```
npm install --dev iso3166-flags

yarn add --dev iso3166-flags
```

Usage
-----
The flags can be implemented in-line by referencing the CSS class of the respective flag using the [`ISO 3166-1`](https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-flags/css/iso3166-1.css) or [`ISO 3166-2`](https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-flags/css/iso3166-1.css) CSS file. For ISO 3166-1 icons add the classes `.fi` and `.fi-xx` (where `xx` is the ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code of a country) to an empty `<span>` [[5]](#references). To add a squared version flag additionally add the class `fis`. 

For example, adding the normal and squared flags for Andorra, Denmark & Panama:
```html
<span class="fi fi-ad"></span> <span class="fi fi-ad fis"></span>
<span class="fi fi-dk"></span> <span class="fi fi-dk fis"></span>
<span class="fi fi-pa"></span> <span class="fi fi-pa fis"></span>
```

For ISO 3166-2 icons add the classes `.fi` and `.fi-xx-yy` (where `xx` is the ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code of a country and `yy` is the ISO 3166-2 code, both in lower-case) to an empty `<span>` [[2]](#references). 

For example, adding the Hungarian county of Heves (HU-HE), the South Sudanese state of Eastern Equatoria (SS-EE) & the Taiwanese county of Miaoli (TW-MIA):
```html
<span class="fi fi-hu-he"></span> <span class="fi fi-hu-he fis"></span>
<span class="fi fi-ss-ee"></span> <span class="fi fi-ss-ee fis"></span>
<span class="fi fi-tw-mia"></span> <span class="fi fi-tw-mia fis"></span>
```

Updates
-------
An important thing to note about the ISO 3166-2 and its subdivision codes/names is that changes are made consistently to it, from a small subdivision name change to an addition/deletion of a whole subdivision. These changes can happen due for a variety of geopolitical and administrative reasons. Therefore, it's important that this library and its JSON have the most **up-to-date, accurate and reliable data**. To achieve this, the custom-built [`iso3166-updates`](https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-updates) repo was created!

The [`iso3166-updates`](https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-updates) repo is another open-source software package and accompanying RESTful API that pulls the latest updates and changes for any and all countries in the ISO 3166 from a variety of data sources including the ISO website itself. A script is called periodically to check for any updates/changes to the subdivisions, which are communicated via the ISO's Online Browsing Platform [[4]](#references), and will then be manually incorporated into this repo. Please visit the repository home page for more info about the purpose and process of the software and API - [`iso3166-updates`](https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-updates).

The list of ISO 3166 updates was last updated on <strong>November 2024</strong> (the last published ISO subdivision change). A log of the latest ISO 3166 updates can be seen in the [UPDATES.md][updates_md] file.
